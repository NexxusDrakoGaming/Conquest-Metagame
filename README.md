# Conquest Metagame Rules *by Nexxus Drako (Pyra Drake)*
*"I came up with the game in a dream of all things. I hope I get to play it someday."* -Pyra Drake

## Requirements
1. Internet connections and video/voice chat for all players if playing online.
2. An internet-connected computer to spin the wheel and maintain results (a physical wheel may not work due to the variance in slices per invasion).
3. A dry erase or "Paint" version of the map.
4. A way to designate capital territories (a token or a mark on the "Paint" map).
5. Multiple 2-player physical board, dice and/or card games, or an online account to a service such as BoardGameArena or Tabletopia.

## Basics
1. This game is optimised for play on a fictional "balkanized" US map.
2. You may play with anywhere between three and eight players. The player who most recently won any kind of game plays first, and play is to continue in descending order of win recency at game start, and will not change mid-game.
3. There must be a host player, who will maintain control of the map and wheel, and acts as a referee. Preferably this would be the most experienced or knowledgeable player. The host receives zero benefits from the role.
4. You start with a single capital territory of your choice, anywhere on the map, if picking after the first player, your capital must not be less than three territories away from any other player. Mark this capital with a token.
5. You can invade adjacent neutral territories by calling and flipping a coin. You win the territory on success, and your turn then ends with either result.
6. When you invade another players adjacent territory, the Invasion phase begins. This will be detailed in its own section.
7. The game ends when one of the three conditions happen; all opponents are eliminated, one player controls more than 75% of the map, or by mutual agreement. The player with the most territories at the end wins the game, and all others are considered losers.

## Invasion Phase
1. Upon invasion, the (online) wheel shall be set up with X slices, X being the combined amount of territories between both players. Double the amount of slices for the defending player if their capital is being invaded.
2. Each player may pick any amount of boardgames to select, and may assign them each up to Y amount of slices on the wheel, Y being half of the amount of territories the player controls.
3. The maximum wheel slices a player can assign is Z, Z being the amount of territories the player controls.
4. The wheel must be spun by the host, and the game chosen by the wheel is played between the two players. The winner that game will gain or keep of control the territory being invaded.
5. If the invading player loses, they must give a territory adjacent to the invaded territory to the winner, they may choose which territory if there are multiple eligible territories.
6. If the capital is being invaded, the invading player must win twice to invade and eliminate the defending player. The defending player will successfully defend if they win either of the two games.
7. Invading an opponents capital will win you all territory they control and eliminate them from the game.
