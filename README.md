# Conquest Metagame Rules *by Nexxus Drako (Pyra Drake)*
*"I came up with the game in a dream of all things. I hope I get to play it someday."* -Pyra Drake

## Requirements
1. Internet connections and video/voice chat for all players if playing online.
2. An internet-connected computer to spin the wheel and maintain results (a physical wheel may not work due to the variance in slices per invasion).
3. A dry erase or "Paint" version of the map.
4. A way to designate capital territories (a token or a mark on the "Paint" map).
5. Objects or counters to act as block and re-spin tokens.
6. Multiple 2-player physical board, dice and/or card games, and/or an online account to a service such as BoardGameArena or Tabletopia.

## Basics
1. This game is optimised for play on a fictional "balkanized" US map with 100 territories.
2. You may play with anywhere between two and eight players. The player who most recently won any kind of game plays first, and play is to continue in descending order of win recency at game start, and will not change mid-game.
3. There must be a host player, who will maintain control of the map and wheel, and acts as a referee. Preferably this would be the most experienced or knowledgeable player. The host receives zero benefits from the role.
4. Players start with a single capital territory of their choice, anywhere on the map, if picking after the first player, their capital must not be less than three territories away from any other player. Mark this capital with a token.
5. Players can invade a single adjacent neutral territory for free, doing so instantly claims that territory, and ends their turn.
6. When a player invade another player's adjacent territory, the Invasion phase begins.
7. The game ends when one of the three conditions happen; all opponents are eliminated, one player controls more than 75% of the map, or by mutual agreement. The player with the most territories at the end wins the game, and all others are considered losers.

## Invasion Phase
1. Upon invasion, the (online) wheel shall be set up with X slices, X being the combined amount of territories between both players.
2. Each player may pick any amount of boardgames to select, and may assign each game a chosen amount of slices on the wheel up to a maximum of Y, Y being half of the amount of territories the player controls, rounded down.
3. The attacking player may declare a sacrifice of up to Y non-capital, non-adjacent territories before their spin to increase their per-game slice cap by the amount of territories sacrificed.
4. The maximum wheel slices a player can assign is Z, Z being the amount of territories the player controls. The maximum must always be assigned.
5. If a defending player's capital is being invaded, the numbers X, Y, and Z are doubled for that invasion only.
6. Winning a duel after sacrificing pre-invasion earns the attacking player a re-spin token. On a later turn, they may spend a re-spin token and a non-capital, non-adjacent territory after spinning the wheel to re-spin the wheel. The result after a single re-spin then stands, and no more re-spins can be made that turn.
7. Winning when defending earns the defending player a block token, they may spend a block token to stop a sacrifice after declaration. They must sacrifice the same amount of territory that the attacker declares to use the token. The attacker does not gain back their sacrificed territories.
8. A player's held re-spin and block tokens persist between turns and invasions. Spent tokens are discarded back into the pool.
9. The wheel must be spun by the host, and the game chosen by the wheel is played between the two players. The winner that game will gain or keep control of the territory being invaded.
10. If the invading player loses, they must give a territory adjacent to the invaded territory to the winner, they may choose which territory if there are multiple eligible territories.
11. If a player's capital is being invaded, the invading player must win the same game twice to invade and eliminate the defending player. The defending player will successfully defend if they win either of the two games.
13. Successfully invading an opponents capital will win them all territory they control and eliminate them from the game.
14. An invader's turn ends after the invasion attempt resolves, and the next player begins their turn.
